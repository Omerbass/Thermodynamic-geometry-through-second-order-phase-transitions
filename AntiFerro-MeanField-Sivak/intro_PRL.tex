The antiferromagnet Ising model in the presence of a uniform magnetic field is a useful example for our analysis, as in these systems, at high enough dimension, it is impossible to traverse from the antiferromagnetic to the disordered phase without crossing a second-order phase transition line \cite{wang1997critical}. Exact solutions for the free energy in antiferromagnetic Ising models in the presence of external field are known only for $1d$ and mean field settings, and in order to explore the crossing of a phase transition we use the latter. With the framework discussed above, we next determine the least-dissipation path between two states 
$\left(T_1,h_1\right)\!\to\!\left(T_2,h_2\right)$, for the mean-field antiferromagnetic model introduced in \cite{vivesUnifiedMeanfieldStudy1997}. 

In this model, the spins $s_i$ are equally split into sublattices $A$ and $B$. A spin in sublattice $A$ interacts with all spins in sublattice $B$ with equal interaction strength, which is antiferromagnetic in sign. There are no interactions between spins in the same sublattice.
Let $m_A=N^{-1}\sum_{i\in A} s_i$ and $m_B = N^{-1}\sum_{i\in B}s_i$ denote the sublattice magnetizations ($N$ is the number of spins in the sublattice). 
The Massieu potential of the system is given by \cite{vivesUnifiedMeanfieldStudy1997}
\begin{eqnarray}
    \psi \;=\ln Z&= -\frac{1}{2}\!\Big[&  \beta K\, m_A m_B \;-\; \beta h\, (m_A+m_B)\nonumber \\
      & &\left. \;+\; \,\big(\vartheta(m_A)+\vartheta(m_B)\big) \right]
\end{eqnarray}
where $\beta=1/T$, $K=-J$ with $J<0$ (antiferromagnetic coupling), and we define
\begin{equation}
    \vartheta(x) \;=\; \frac{1}{2}\Big[(1+x)\log(1+x)+(1-x)\log(1-x)\Big].
\end{equation}

Since there is no notion of correlation length in this model, we use the response time directly to evaluate the relaxation rates. As shown in the end matter, assuming Glauber rates for a single transition with a microscopic timescale $\Gamma$, the dissipation metric is given by 
\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation}
\resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{$
\begin{aligned}
    g_{\mu\nu}
    \;= & \; \frac{\beta}{2\Gamma\big(1-\beta^2 K^2 \zeta_A \zeta_B\big)^{\!2}}
    \begin{pmatrix}
    \scriptstyle K^2 \!\left[\!\big(1+\beta^2 K^2 \zeta_A \zeta_B\big)\big(m_A^2 \zeta_B + m_B^2 \zeta_A\big) - 4\beta K\, m_A m_B \zeta_A \zeta_B \!\right]
    &
    \scriptstyle -K \!\left[\!\big(1+\beta^2 K^2 \zeta_A \zeta_B\big)\big(m_A \zeta_B+m_B \zeta_A\big) - 2\beta K (m_A+m_B)\zeta_A\zeta_B \!\right]
    \\[6pt]
    \scriptstyle -K \!\left[\!\big(1+\beta^2 K^2 \zeta_A \zeta_B\big)\big(m_A \zeta_B+m_B \zeta_A\big) - 2\beta K (m_A+m_B)\zeta_A\zeta_B \!\right]
    &
    \scriptstyle \big(1+\beta^2 K^2 \zeta_A \zeta_B\big)(\zeta_A+\zeta_B) - 4\beta K\,\zeta_A\zeta_B
    \end{pmatrix}\!
\end{aligned}
$}
\end{equation}
\end{widetext}
where $\zeta_i = 1-m_i^2$, and where $m_A$ and $m_B$ are the minimizer of $\psi$, satisfying the mean-field equations
\begin{align}
    m_A &= \tanh\!\left(\beta h - \beta K\, m_B\right) \label{eq:SCEmAB-A}\\
    m_B &= \tanh\!\left(\beta h - \beta K\, m_A\right) \label{eq:SCEmAB-B}
\end{align}
Let us discuss the implications of this metric on the two sides of the phase transition: the disordered and ordered phases.
