We identify four distinct classes of minimal (shortest) paths. If both initial and final points are in the disordered phase, then the shortest path is achieved by traversing along the constant magnetization towards $\beta=0$, then changing the external magnetic field until the correct value of total magnetization is achieved, and traversing back along a constant total magnetization line to the final point. 


In the second case, the initial and final states are in different phases. The optimal trajectory, which for simplicity we choose to initiate in the antiferromagnetic phase, starts from the initial point to the nearest point on the phase transition line, crosses into the disordered phase, and then ascends to infinite temperature ($\beta = 0$). Once at $\beta = 0$, the trajectory traverses at this value of $\beta$---where the thermodynamic length is minimal---until reaching the final magnetization value, and finally descends along the constant-magnetization line to the final point.

In the third case, both points are in the antiferromagnetic phase, and the geodesic line connecting them is shorter than any path that detours through the disordered region.  Here, the minimal path lies entirely within the ordered manifold.

The fourth case occurs when both endpoints are in the antiferromagnetic phase, but it is nevertheless shorter to cross the phase transition back and forth to the disorder phase than to remain entirely within the ordered region across all the trajectory. Because paths within the disordered phase have zero thermodynamic length except for the section at $\beta=0$, the total length of such a trajectory is often dominated by the two crossings, and can be shorter than any trajectory that does not cross the phase transition.
An illustration of these paths is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:shortestPaths}.

The thermodynamic lengths within the antiferromagnetic phase were computed using the Fast Marching Method \cite{kimmelComputingGeodesicPaths1998}, following the approach used in \cite{rotskoffDynamicRiemannianGeometry2015}. 
Minimal paths were obtained by performing gradient descent along the numerically computed distance function.
