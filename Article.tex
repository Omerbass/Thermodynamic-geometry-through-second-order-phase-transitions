\section{Introduction}

Attempts to geometrize thermodynamic parameter space have existed since the theory's early days \cite{gibbs1873method}. While we have a geometric interpretation for equilibrium thermodynamics, for example the  work performed by a heat engine can be related to the area of a stroke in the PV plane,
% entropy/heat generation in equilibrium thermodynamics - the first law, 
there does not exist an analogous relation for excess, non-equilibrium dissipation. 
One similar relation for excess dissipation in non-equilibrium processes, proposed in the 1970-s, is called thermodynamic geometry. 
Laid out by Ruppiner and Weinhold \cite{ruppeinerThermodynamicsRiemannianGeometric1979, weinholdMetricGeometryEquilibrium1975}, this formalism defines a Riemannian metric on thermodynamic parameter space.
The Riemannian metric, which defines this manifold, is simply the second derivatives of the energy, entropy or their Legendre transforms. Use of different thermodynamic potentials to derive the metric, evidently, still gives the same manifold \cite{salamonRelationEntropyEnergy1984}. 

Salomon \cite{salamonThermodynamicLengthDissipated1983} showed in the 1980s that excess dissipation is related to lengths in this metric space, subject to two major caveats.
Firstly, it was proved only for endoreversible processes. Here, endoreversible denotes processes where the system is in internal thermodynamic equilibrium, but may not be in equilibrium with the surroundings. Secondly, the dissipation contains a term of the mean response time of the system. Meaning, that the formalism does not work well in systems with large variations in response time.
This formalism has been used to calculate minimal entropy production protocols in non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems, for example, in distillation and in chemical reactions \cite{andresenCurrentTrendsFiniteTime2011}. 

In 2012 Sivak and Crooks \cite{sivakThermodynamicMetricsOptimal2012} defined a similar metric using linear response theory. This was a continuation of earlier work by Crooks \cite{crooksMeasuringThermodynamicLength2007}. In their definition, the response time was integrated into the metric itself. Therefore, this formalism removed the need for both the response time, and the assumption of endoreversibility, making it applicable to a much wider variety of systems. This includes systems with a widely varying timescales, as well as microscopic systems (e.g biological or single molecule systems). This framework served as an optimization tool for computing systems \cite{rotskoffGeometricApproachOptimal2017}.

One example of a class of systems with widely varying timescales is systems with phase transitions. Several researchers have shown interest in applying thermodynamic geometry to such systems \cite{janyszekRiemannianGeometryThermodynamics1989, PhysRevE.51.1006}. This includes searching for optimal paths in such systems (e.g the 2D ferromagnetic Ising model \cite{rotskoffDynamicRiemannianGeometry2015}). However, the divergence of the thermodynamic length near phase transitions attracted only limited attention. 
Note that divergence of the metric does not necessarily imply divergence of the thermodynamic length. This is evident from many examples, such as the divergence of the Schwarzschild metric at $r=r_s$. 
% {there has yet to be an exhaustive study of the divergence of the thermodynamic length around phase transitions}
Some systems have entirely disconnected phases, such that changing the system from one state to the other necessitates crossing a phase transition. One such example that we will study in this paper is the Anti-Ferromagnet. 
For these reasons, it is important to know wether the thermodynamic length converges or not in the vicinity of phase transitions to understand the applicability of thermodynamic geometry for systems with phase transitions.

One property that is immediately evident from Ruppiner, and Sivak`s definitions, and is presented in the following part (\ref{sec:framework}), is that the metric should diverge in the vicinity of the phase transition. A question that arises is whether a divergence of the metric translates to divergence of lengths.

Note that if lengths don't diverge, there might still be other signs of divergence in the manifold, such as curvature. However these don't affect the dissipation so we are less interested in them for this study.

In this article we explore thermodynamic geometry in the vicinity of second order phase transitions. We show markedly different behavior of the two manifolds (Ruppiner and Sivak metrics) around phase transitions, stemming from critical slowdown. 
One interesting finding is that in both the Ruppiner and Sivak definitions there are cases where the metric doesn't diverge.

We then apply the framework to the Sivak metric to find the shortest protocol between 2 points that belong to different phases of the Mean-Field Anti-Ferromagnet. 
In this model, the phase transition line completely separates the two phases (unlike, for example, the ferromagnetic Ising model), such that any protocol crossing the phase transition must pass through a phase transition.

We see in our work that the thermodynamic length can diverge in some models with the Sivak metric. In all the models we have checked, the lengths converge for the Rupinner metric.

\section{Framework\label{sec:framework}}
Before discussing the implementation of thermodynamic geometry on second order phase transitions, we first define clearly the metrics laid out before, as well as the tools we  use as part of our analysis.
\subsection{Ruppiner and Weinhold Metric}
The Ruppiner and Weinhold metric \cite{ruppeinerThermodynamicsRiemannianGeometric1979, weinholdMetricGeometryEquilibrium1975} is defined by the second derivatives of the thermodynamic potentials or generalized entropies:
\begin{equation}
    g_{\mu\nu}^{\text{Ruppiner}} \equiv g_{\mu\nu}^R= \pm \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial \lambda ^\mu \partial\lambda^\nu}, 
\end{equation}
where $ \varphi $ can be the energy, entropy or their Legendre transforms (i.e the Gibbs free energy, Masseiu potential and so on), and $ \lambda ^ \mu $ are the corresponding natural variables of the chosen thermodynamic potential (e.g $\{S, M\}$ - the entropy and total magnetization - for the internal energy $E$ of a magnetic system). 
The sign is chosen such that the metric is positive-definite, which is possible for a proper choice of $\varphi$ and $\lambda^\mu$, based on the convexity/concavity of the thermodynamic potentials and entropies \cite{Callen:450289}. 
% The definition is symmetric ($g_{\mu\nu}=g_{\nu\mu}$).
Salamon \cite{salamonThermodynamicLengthDissipated1983} showed that this metric is connected to non-equilibrium dissipation,
via the ``dissipated availability" 
\begin{equation} \label{SalomonDissipatedAvail}
    \mathcal{A} = \bar{\epsilon} \intop_{\boldsymbol{\lambda} \left(s\right)} g^R_{\mu\nu} \partial_{s^\prime}\lambda^{\mu} \partial_{s^\prime}\lambda^{\nu} ds^\prime
\end{equation}
Here $\boldsymbol{\lambda} \left( s \right)$ is the path, parameterized by $s$. $ \bar{\epsilon}$ is the averaged response time of the system (sometimes also referred to as "lag time"). The dissipated availability is the excess heat (or excess entropy, if using a generalized entropy) generated by the system due to finite time effects. Accordingly, one can see that in the quasi-static limie ($ \left| \dot{\boldsymbol{\lambda}} \right| \rightarrow 0 $), the dissipated availability approaches 0. The ``thermodynamic length" associated with the metric, is given by:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:L-def}    
    \mathcal{L} = \intop_{\boldsymbol{\lambda} \left(t\right)} \sqrt{g_{\mu\nu} \partial_s\lambda^{\mu} \partial_s\lambda^{\nu} } ds,
\end{equation}
It is an entirely mathematical construction, but minimization of the thermodynamic length, $\mathcal{L}$, is identical to minimization of the dissipated availability, $\mathcal{A}$, when fixing the time of the protocol. The length $\mathcal{L}$ gives a lower bound on the dissipated availability by the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{A} \ge \frac{\bar{\epsilon}}{\tau} \mathcal{L}^2
\end{equation}
With $\tau$ being the time of the protocol. Equality is attained when $ \left| \dot{\boldsymbol{\lambda}} \right| = \sqrt{\dot{\lambda}^{\mu} g_{\mu\nu} \dot{\lambda}^{\nu}} $ is constant \cite{salamonThermodynamicLengthDissipated1983}.

\subsection{Sivak and Crooks Metric}
The endoreversible assumption, or a similar assumption about the relaxation time, essential for using the above metric, is severely limiting. Sivak and Crooks \cite{sivakThermodynamicMetricsOptimal2012} developed a similar formalism that does not require this assumption, and is thus usable across a wider range of applications.
This came at the price of a change in the definition of the metric:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:SivakMetric}
    g_{\mu\nu}^{\text{Sivak}} \equiv g_{\mu\nu}^S = \intop_0^\infty \left\langle \delta X_\mu (t) \delta X_\nu (0) \right\rangle dt = \mathcal{T}_{\mu\nu} \frac{\partial^2 \ln Z}{\partial \lambda^{\mu} \partial \lambda^{\nu}}
\end{equation}
Where as before $\lambda^\mu$ are the natural variables of the Masseiu potential, e.g $\{\beta, \beta h\}$ for magnetic systems, and $\boldsymbol{X}$ are the conjugate variables to $ \boldsymbol{\lambda} $ (in equilibrium, $X_\mu = \frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial \lambda^\mu}$), $\mathcal{T}$ is the time response matrix, and $Z$ is the partition function. The the last equality is generically true in the thermodynamic limit,  \cite{sivakThermodynamicMetricsOptimal2012}, but for general, microscopic systems there is an added expression in the definition of the metric.

In the Sivak formalism the response time is directly encoded in the metric through $\mathcal{T}
$. Accordingly, we redefine $ \mathcal{A} $ to be
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:SivakDissAv}
    \mathcal{A} = \intop_{\boldsymbol\lambda \left(t\right)} g^S_{\mu\nu} \partial_t\lambda^{\mu} \partial_t\lambda^{\nu} dt,
\end{equation}
 

The definition of $\mathcal{L}$ stays identical, apart for the use of the Sivak metric. The Cauchy-Schwartz inequality gives in this case:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:CSineq}
    \mathcal{A} \ge \frac{\mathcal{L}^2}{\tau}
\end{equation}
With $\tau$ being the time of the protocol. As before, equality is attained when $\left| \dot{\boldsymbol{\lambda}} \right| = \sqrt{\dot{\lambda}^{\mu} g_{\mu\nu} \dot{\lambda}^{\nu}}$ is constant \cite{sivakThermodynamicMetricsOptimal2012}.

\subsection{Scaling Hypothesis \label{subsec:ScalingHypothesisFramework}}
% \oren{I think that it is better to first state the motivation and approach, something along the line of: (i) We expect the metric to be singular near a phase transition; (ii) There are very few cases where exact calculation of this singularity is possible; (iii) The singularity is governed by a set of critical exponents and scaling functions, that are identical for all models that belong to a given universality class. Therefore, we can learn a lot on the behavior of the metric near the phase transition by using the scaling hypothesis approach.}

The second derivatives of the free energy often diverges around second order phase transitions (e.g. the diverging magnetic susceptibility in a ferromagnet). Exact calculation of a system's partition function is many times hard or even impossible. 
However, the divergence of the partition function, and therefore its derivatives (e.g the Ruppiner metric), is dominated by the critical exponents. Those, in turn, will dictate whether the thermodynamic length diverges through the phase transition or not.
%Therefore there exist tools such as critical exponents that enable us to characterize these divergences without calculating them directly. 
Moreover, phase transitions have been organized into universality classes which are distinct from one another by the critical exponents.

The scaling hypothesis is a general relation between the critical exponents and the scaling of the free energy, around the phase transition \cite{Kardar_2007}. It allows us to check, for many different universality classes simultaneously, whether the thermodynamic length in the Ruppiner formalism diverges or not.
However, this does not tell us anything about the relaxation time, or its behavior around the phase transition. Therefore, this tool is not enough to understand divergences in the Sivak metric. 

The statement underpinning the scaling hypothesis is that around the phase transition point $ (T_c, h_c) $, the thermodynamic potentials scale as \cite{Kardar_2007}:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:scalingHypFreeEnergy}
    \varphi \propto t^b f \left( \frac{h}{t^\Delta} \right)
\end{equation}
where we have defined the reduced parameters around the phase transition point
\begin{equation}
    t = \frac{T-T_c}{T_c}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    h = \frac{H-H_c}{H_c}
\end{equation}
meaning as we approach $ (T_c, h_c) $ we expect $t,h\rightarrow 0 $.

The hypothesis states that $f$ is continuous, and $ f \left(x\right) \xrightarrow[x\rightarrow\infty]{} x^p $. 

The variables $b, \Delta$ and $p$ can be determined from the critical exponents. For example, one can observe the critical exponent of the heat capacity at $h=0$, $\alpha$, is related to $b$ by $b=2-\alpha$.

The scaling hypothesis has been used before to quantify divergence of the metric, e.g \cite{PhysRevE.51.1006}. However, its impact on the thermodynamic length and dissipation has not been considered. 

\subsubsection*{Dynamic Scaling Hypothesis}
The scaling hypothesis can provide useful information about the divergence of the Ruppiner and Weinhold metric near a second order phase transition. However, commonly a second order phase transition is accompanied by a critical slow down, where the response timescale diverges. This can manifest itself in $ \bar{\epsilon} $, the mean response time, which may depend on the position, and even diverges at the critical point.
% change for different paths that get closer or further away from the phase transition. 
Gaining information about the critical slowdown can help us to quantify the divergence of $ \bar{\epsilon} $ in the Salomon dissipated availability (eq. \ref{SalomonDissipatedAvail}), 
and also the divergences of the Sivak metric (eq. \ref{eq:SivakMetric}).

The dynamical scaling hypothesis provides a relation between the relaxation time $\tau$ and the correlation length $\xi$ \cite{tauberCriticalDynamicsField2014}:
\begin{equation}
    \tau \propto \xi ^ z.
\end{equation}
This can be related to the scaling hypothesis of the free energy by the relation between free energies and the correlation length \cite{Kardar_2007}:
\begin{equation}
    \varphi \propto \xi ^ {-d}
\end{equation}
Where $d$ is the dimension of the system. This implies
\begin{equation}
    \tau \propto \varphi^{-\nicefrac{z}{d}}
\end{equation}
and using eq.\;\ref{eq:scalingHypFreeEnergy}, the scaling of the response time in terms of $t, h$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
        \tau \propto t^{-\nicefrac{bz}{d}} f ^{-\nicefrac{z}{d}} \left( \frac{h}{t^\Delta} \right)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Divergence of Lengths}
As is known, divergence of the metric doesn't necessarily imply divergence of distances in the manifold. One can construct metrics that diverge, while lengths remain finite. One known example of a metric with both a real divergence and a divergence with finite lengths is the Schwarzschild metric. While the metric itself diverges both at $ r=0 $ and at the Schwarzschild radius $r=r_s $, lengths diverge at $ r \rightarrow 0 $, but not at $ r \rightarrow r_s$. 


It is important to note that the divergence of dissipated availability depends not only on the shape on the protocol in parameter space, but also on its exact time parametrization. In other words, along any given path, if the protocol is executed sufficiently fast, the dissipated availability  diverges, since Eq. \ref{eqn:SivakDissAv} is sensitive to the parametrization. 
% However, at very high driving speeds the endoreversible/linear-response approximations used in deriving the dissipation expression are no longer valid.

This naturally raises the following question: can thermodynamic length provide insight into the divergence of dissipated availability? One direction is straightforward: for constant-dissipation-rate protocols, the dissipated availability and the thermodynamic length are connected directly through the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality. Therefore, whenever the thermodynamic length converges, there must exist a protocol for which the dissipated availability also converges.

The reverse implication is less obvious: if the thermodynamic length diverges, can there still exist a finite-time protocol yielding convergent dissipated availability? This case can also be addressed using the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality. Specifically, the minimal dissipated availability occurs when the protocol duration scales as $\tau \propto \mathcal{L}$. In this case, Eq. \ref{eq:CSineq} gives
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{A}_{\text{min}} = \frac{\mathcal{L}}{c} \xrightarrow[\mathcal{L\rightarrow\infty}]{}\infty
\end{equation}
which shows that a divergent thermodynamic length necessarily implies divergent dissipated availability.

Thus, there are protocols that converge if and only if the thermodynamic length converges. Therefore we need to look only at the rate of divergence of
\begin{equation}
    \ell(s) = \sqrt{g_{\mu\nu} \partial_s \lambda^\mu \partial_s \lambda^\nu},
\end{equation}
i.e, assuming (as we assume in the rest of this paper) $\ell \xrightarrow[s\rightarrow 0]{} \infty$, the thermodynamic length  diverges if and only if $\ell \propto s^{-p}$ where $p>1$. Note that this cannot be directly translated to a divergence of the metric since it is parametrization dependent, similarly to how there exist coordinate systems where the $r_s$ divergence of the Schwarzschild metric do not appear (e.g Kruskal coordinates\cite{PhysRev.119.1743,Szekeres:1960gm}).


\section{Results}
\subsection{Scaling Hypothesis \label{subsec:ScalingHypothesisResults}}
\subsubsection{Scaling Hypothesis for the Free Energy}
We use the scaling hypothesis for the free energy to deduce the divergence of the Ruppiner metric, and understand wether the length diverges on paths that pass through a phase transition.


Assuming the divergent part of the Massieu potential scales as
\[ \psi \propto t^b f\left(\frac{h}{t^\Delta}\right) \]
With all the assumptions made so far, the scaling of the metric as $t,h\rightarrow 0 $ is given by:
\begin{align}
    \left(g_{\mu\nu}\right) \Big|_{\frac{h}{t^\Delta} \rightarrow \text{const.}} & \propto \left(\begin{array}{cc}
        t^{b-2} & t^{b-\Delta-1} \\
        t^{b-\Delta-1} & t^{b-2 \Delta}
    \end{array} \right) \\
    \left( g_{\mu\nu} \right) \Big|_{\frac{h}{t^\Delta} \rightarrow \infty} & \propto \left(\begin{array}{cc}
        t^{-2} h^{p} & t^{-1} h^{p-1} \\
        t^{-1} h^{p-1} & h^{p-2}
    \end{array} \right)
\end{align}
Note how we take the limits: We take both $t$ and $h$ to $0$, in such a way that either $\frac{h}{t^\Delta}$ tends to a constant value, or to infinity. This gives different limits for $f$, and therefore also different limits for the thermodynamic potentials and the metric, as seen in \ref{subsec:ScalingHypothesisFramework}.

To determine from this how lengths diverge, we need information about the path taken, as it determines the asymptotic {behaviour} of $ \frac{h}{t^\Delta} $. We therefore split our analysis to corresponding cases. The first is
\begin{equation} \label{case_1}
    \left( \begin{array}{c}
         t \\
         h 
    \end{array} \right) = \left( \begin{array}{c}
         s \\
         s^k 
    \end{array} \right) , \quad k \ge \Delta
\end{equation}
Which implies
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{h}{t^\Delta} \xrightarrow[s\rightarrow0]{} \text{const.}
\end{equation*}
In this case, the integrands are
\begin{equation*}
    g_{tt} \frac{dt}{ds} \frac{dt}{ds} \propto s^{b-2}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    g_{th} \frac{dt}{ds} \frac{dh}{ds} \propto s^{b-\Delta-1} s^{k-1}=s^{b-2+\left(k-\Delta\right)}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    g_{hh} \frac{dh}{ds} \frac{dh}{ds} \propto s^{b-2\Delta} s^{2\left(k-1\right)} =s^{b-2+2\left(k-\Delta\right)}
\end{equation*}
Since $k\ge\Delta$ we get that 
\begin{equation} \label{h_t_delta_non_divergent}
    b > 0
\end{equation} 
is a sufficient condition for the Ruppiener length, $\mathcal{L}$, to converge. Which, as we have established, is a necessary and sufficient condition for convergence of the Salomon dissipated availability, $\mathcal{A}$, for finite time protocols, unless $\bar{\epsilon}$ diverges. 

The second option is
\begin{equation} \label{case_2}
    \left( \begin{array}{c}
         t \\
         h 
    \end{array} \right) = \left( \begin{array}{c}
         s^{\nicefrac{1}{k}} \\
         s 
    \end{array} \right) , \quad k < \Delta
\end{equation}
which implies
\begin{equation*} 
    \frac{h}{t^\Delta} \xrightarrow[s\rightarrow 0]{} \infty
\end{equation*}
In this case
\begin{equation*}
    g_{tt} \frac{dt}{ds} \frac{dt}{ds} \propto s^{-\nicefrac{2}{k}}s^p s^{2\left(\frac{2}{k}-1\right)} = s^{p-2}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    g_{th} \frac{dt}{ds} \frac{dh}{ds} \propto s^{-\nicefrac{1}{k}} s^{p-1} s^{\frac{1}{k}-1} = s^{p-2}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    g_{hh} \frac{dh}{ds} \frac{dh}{ds} \propto s^{p-2}
\end{equation*}


So there exist finite time protocols that do not diverge for a system when
\begin{equation} \label{h_t_delta_divergent}
    p>0
\end{equation}
% \oren{Same as the discussion above -- why not $p>1$?}
One can observe in table \ref{tab:scaling-divergences} that both conditions \ref{h_t_delta_non_divergent} and \ref{h_t_delta_divergent} hold in multiple universality classes.  %\oren{Maybe it is better to put the specific mean field example here, as it actually belong to the above discussion, not to what follow.} \omer{The mean field discussion was supposed to be for the numerical part, should it appear also in the context of scaling of the free energy/its derivatives?}

\subsubsection{Dynamical Scaling Hypothesis}

As we have seen, all attempts to use metrics to study dissipation take into account the system's response time. In the Ruppiner formalism this appears in the mean response time element $\bar{\epsilon}$, and in the Sivak formalism it appears directly in the metric. Here we use the dynamical scaling hypothesis to study the scaling of the response time, $\tau$.

We have seen that $\tau$ scales as:
$ \tau \propto \psi ^ {-\nicefrac{z}{d} } $, so using the static scaling hypothesis
\begin{equation}
    \tau \propto t^{-\nicefrac{bz}{d}} g\left(\frac{h}{t^\Delta}\right)
\end{equation}
with $g$ continuous and 
\begin{equation}
    g \xrightarrow[x\rightarrow \infty]{} x^{-\nicefrac{pz}{d}},
\end{equation}
the divergence of $\tau$ is
\begin{equation}
    \tau \propto 
    \begin{cases}
        t^{-\nicefrac{bz}{d}}  &  \frac{h}{t^\Delta} \rightarrow \text{const.} \\
        h^{-\nicefrac{pz}{d}}  &  \frac{h}{t^\Delta} \rightarrow \infty
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Adding this factor to the case of the divergences in eq. \ref{case_1}
\begin{align}
    g_{tt} \left(\frac{dt}{ds}\right)^2 & \propto s^{b\left(1-\frac{z}{d}\right) -2 } \\
    g_{th} \frac{dt}{ds} \frac{dh}{ds} & \propto s^{b\left(1-\frac{z}{d}\right) -2 + \left(k-\Delta\right) } \\
    g_{hh} \left(\frac{dh}{ds}\right)^2 & \propto s^{b\left(1-\frac{z}{d}\right) -2 + 2\left(k-\Delta\right)} 
\end{align}
Meaning the convergence condition for the thermodynamic length will be 
\begin{equation}
    b\left(1-\frac{z}{d}\right) > 0
\end{equation}

Similarly in case \ref{case_2}:
\begin{equation}
    g_{ij}  \frac{dx^i}{ds} \frac{dx^j}{ds} \propto s^{p\left(1-\frac{z}{d}\right) -2}
\end{equation}
Meaning the convergence condition for the thermodynamic length will be 
\begin{equation}
    p\left(1-\frac{z}{d}\right) > 0
\end{equation}
One can see, using table \ref{tab:dynamical-divergences}, that the lengths will diverge for the 2D Ising model and Potts models (both 3- and 4-states), but in the 3D Ising model, lengths converge.
