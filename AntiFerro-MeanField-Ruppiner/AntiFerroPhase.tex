\subsubsection{Antiferromagnetic Phase}

As previously mentioned, in the anti-ferromagnetic phase the metric is non-degenerate. Hence, the problem of finding shortest paths is 2D. We used numeric methods to find the shortest paths from a given point to different points on the phase transition line.

Calculation of the shortest path to the phase transition line from the inner point was done using the fast marching method\cite{kimmelComputingGeodesicPaths1998}.
